# Data-Science-Specialization
This the first repository I create in GitHub. This is meant to help me learn how to create and work with repositories, start and manage branches, make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits and open and merge pull requests. In the future, I will use gitHub to share code developed for psychological and neuroscience research.
